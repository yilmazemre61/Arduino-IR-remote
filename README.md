# Arduino-IR-remote
Level-2-- Add a second LED(red) and have the following 5 functionalities using 5 different buttons on the remote. NOTE: You may use any buttons you choose.
→ Button 1 = turn on blue LED
→ Button 2 = turn on red LED
→ Button 3 = turn off blue LED
→ Button 4 = turn off red LED
→ Button 5 = flash both LEDs 3 times
Level-3-- Create a system to control the brightness on the RGB led. Use two buttons to control the brightness, one turn brightness up, one turns it down(you can choose the amount of brightness 1 button press equals). Then have a third button that will change the colour. You can choose to keep the previous colour on OR only keep the active colour on. If the LED is at the lowest or highest brightness the value should not change.
Level-4-- Make anything. Create unique code with a specified functionality. The only requirements are that you need to use the IR remote and you must have at least 50 lines of code with at least 1 method.
